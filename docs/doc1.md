# docs page

this is the first docs page, and it has a [relative link](doc2.md/#doc2-subsection) to doc2.md.
the relative link is `doc2.md/#doc2-subsection`, so need the full file extension. but it works nicely and I appreciate that. and I have `mkdocs serve` running in the background right now and the website is live-updating as I save.

I was excited to try out [instant previews](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/#instant-previews) but it turns out it's only for sponsors starting at $15/month, which, nope :/.
